## Beginner-Level Questions

### Question 1: Conditional Statements
Write a Python program that simulates a login activity. The program should:
- Ask the user to input a username and password.
- If the username is 'user' and the password is 'python123', print "Welcome!". Otherwise, print "Invalid Credentials."

### Question 2: Loops
Write a Python program to print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a `for` loop.

## Intermediate-Level Questions

### Question 3: Nested Loops
Create a program that displays the multiplication table from 1 to 10. Use nested `for` loops to format the output.

**Example Output:**
```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
...
10 x 10 = 100
```

### Question 4: Functions and Return Types
Write a Python function named `is_prime()` that takes an integer as an input and returns:
- `True` if the number is a prime number.
- `False` otherwise.

## Advanced-Level Questions

### Question 5: Error Handling and File Operations
Write a Python program that:
- Prompts the user to enter the name of a text file.
- Reads the file if it exists and displays its content.
- If the file doesnâ€™t exist, handles the error gracefully and creates the file with a default message "This is a new file."

### Question 6: Object-Oriented Programming
Create a Python class named `BankAccount` with the following attributes and methods:
- Attributes: `account_number`, `account_holder`, `balance`
- Methods:
  - `deposit(amount)`: Adds the specified amount to the balance.
  - `withdraw(amount)`: Deducts the specified amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available. Otherwise, prints "Insufficient balance."
  - `display_balance()`: Displays the current balance.

Write a script to create an instance of the class and demonstrate all the methods.

### Assignments

#### Beginner-Level Assignment
1. Write a Python program to check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using an `if-elif-else` statement.
2. Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and prints the square of each number using a `for` loop.

#### Intermediate-Level Assignment
1. Write a Python program to implement a simple calculator. The program should:
   - Accept two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - Perform the operation and display the result.
2. Write a function named `fibonacci(n)` that returns the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

#### Advanced-Level Assignment
1. Create a Python script that uses a `while` loop to implement a login system where users are given three attempts to enter the correct credentials.
2. Write a program that creates a class `Employee` with attributes `name`, `position`, and `salary`, and a method `annual_salary()` that calculates the annual salary. Create multiple employee objects and find the highest annual salary among them.
