The provided document is a summary of a meeting that took place on July 27, 2025, at 09:44 GMT+05:30. The AI Council led the discussion, focusing on regression for continuous value prediction.

Here's a breakdown of the key topics:

  * **Regression Concept and Best Fit Line:** The AI Council introduced regression as a method for predicting continuous values, contrasting it with categorical predictions. They explained that linear regression aims to find a "best fit line" to minimize error and introduced the equation ŷ = w₀ + w₁x, where w₀ is the intercept and w₁ is the slope, both learned by the model.
  * **Minimizing Error with Gradient Descent:** The discussion elaborated on how the "best fit line" minimizes the error between actual and calculated values, using the gradient descent process to tune weights and decrease error.
  * **Practical Application with Advertising Data:** The AI Council demonstrated linear regression using an advertising-versus-sales dataset to predict sales based on advertisement costs (TV, radio, newspaper) and understand their impact. They covered splitting data, importing libraries, and making predictions.
  * **Multiple Linear Regression and Feature Importance:** The meeting explored multiple linear regression, showing how using multiple features (like TV and radio) can improve model performance. They also discussed evaluating feature importance using pair plots and correlation analysis, noting that newspaper advertisement was less important than TV and radio.
  * **Correlation Calculation:** The AI Council explained how correlation is calculated, providing the mathematical formula and illustrating how it helps determine positive or negative relationships between variables. They demonstrated calculating the correlation between TV advertisement costs and sales, which showed a strong positive correlation.
  * **Nonlinear Regression through Data Transformation:** The concept of nonlinear regression was introduced as a way to achieve better results in certain scenarios. It was clarified that a separate library isn't needed; instead, data is transformed to incorporate higher-order terms (e.g., x and x² for a two-degree nonlinear equation), allowing the model to learn additional coefficients for non-linear relationships.
  * **Nonlinear Regression with Polynomial Features:** The AI Council demonstrated building a nonlinear regression model by transforming data to a higher degree (e.g., 3-degree transformation adds another coefficient). They explained that using transformed data with the same algorithm enables nonlinear regression and illustrated plotting a nonlinear fit using `PolynomialFeatures` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
  * **Model Training and Prediction with Transformed Data:** The process of building a nonlinear model using `LinearRegression` after transforming data with `PolynomialFeatures` was detailed. They also covered creating a sequential data range for prediction and noted that transformed `X_train` would have multiple features.
  * **Performance Evaluation and Assignment:** The AI Council discussed evaluating model performance using Mean Absolute Error. They concluded that if linear and nonlinear models perform similarly, there's no benefit to using the nonlinear model due to increased features and slower processing.

**Assigned Task:** Assigned the task of implementing and training a nonlinear regression model using both TV and radio as features and then evaluating its performance. The AI Council also clarified that both linear and nonlinear models are used, with nonlinear models preferred only if they improve performance.
