The provided meeting notes from September 7, 2025, primarily discuss the introduction of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) and Git for version control.

Here's a summary of the key points:

  * **MLOps Introduction:** AI Council introduced MLOps as the next milestone after DevOps, aiming to bridge the gap between ML model development and operations for seamless deployment and continuous integration.
  * **MLOps Importance:** MLOps is crucial for automation, consistency in model training, collaboration among teams, scalability to handle larger datasets, and early problem detection through monitoring.
  * **MLOps Stages:** The core stages of MLOps include training, testing, deployment, monitoring, and updating of machine learning models.
  * **Real-World Analogy:** MLOps stages were explained using a cake/pizza preparation analogy, mapping recipe to ML model, ingredients to data, kitchen setup to infrastructure, and so on.
  * **Git for Version Control:** Git was introduced as a critical open-source, distributed version control system for MLOps, recording file changes over time and maintaining historical versions of code.
  * **Git's Role in MLOps:** Git facilitates version control, team collaboration, experiment tracking, branching for different roles, and supports Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
  * **Git and VS Code Installation:** Attendees were instructed to install Git from [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and VS Code, which will replace Jupyter Notebook for future development.
  * **Git Repositories:** The concept of local (on user's computer) and remote (cloud-hosted) repositories was explained, with services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket being mentioned.
  * **Git Configuration:** Attendees were guided through configuring Git with `user.name` and `user.email` to track changes, highlighting its importance for projects with multiple contributors.
  * **Local Repository Initialization:** The process of initializing any directory as a local Git repository using `git init` was demonstrated, creating a hidden `.git` folder.
  * **Troubleshooting:** AI Council provided assistance to Ananya Thakur and Varun with command prompt basics (`mkdir`, `cd`, `pwd`) and local repository creation issues.
  * **Future Plans:** The meeting concluded with plans to finish covering Git in the next session, followed by modularizing code.
