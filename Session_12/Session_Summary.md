The meeting on August 2, 2025, at 09:46 GMT+05:30, involved the AI Council discussing several topics in machine learning. Key points included:

  * **Review of Previous Sessions:** The AI Council reviewed classification models, specifically with wine data, emphasizing the importance of scaling in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). They also covered linear regression, including the learning process, error optimization, and multiple linear regression with cross-validation.
  * **Non-Linearity in Models:** The discussion moved to implementing non-linearity in models by transforming data (e.g., x to x², x³) to create best-fit non-linear lines. They demonstrated using `PolynomialFeatures` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to transform multiple features, leading to an increased number of components.
  * **Model Training and Evaluation with Non-Linearity:** After transformation, a linear regression model was trained on polynomial features, and its performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Applying non-linearity to both TV and radio features significantly reduced MAE to 0.39, while increasing the degree of non-linearity (e.g., to 3 degrees) improved accuracy but increased model size and resource consumption.
  * **Feature Interaction:** Feature interaction was introduced as an alternative to improve model performance without significantly increasing model size. This involves multiplying different features (e.g., X1 \* X2), which demonstrated a reduction in MAE from 1.2 to 0.63.
  * **Handling Missing Values:** A practical approach to handling missing values in a dataset (item and outlet information) was demonstrated. This included checking data shape, types, and unique values. Missing 'outlet size' values were filled based on their relationship with 'outlet location type' using multivariate analysis and lambda functions for efficient scripting.
  * **Time Module and Performance Comparison:** The `time` module was used to compare execution times of normal functions versus lambda functions for DataFrame operations. While small datasets didn't show significant differences, a larger dataset (1 million entries) clearly showed list comprehension to be much faster than a traditional loop.
  * **Converting Non-Numerical to Numerical Data:** The process of converting non-numerical columns to numerical formats for linear regression was covered, identifying columns like 'item identifier' and 'outlet identifier'. Label encoding was explained for categorical and ordinal data, and one-hot encoding for nominal data, along with transforming the 'year' column into 'age'.
  * **Linear Regression Model Building and Evaluation:** The steps for building a linear regression model to predict sales were outlined, including data splitting, training, and evaluating performance using MAE (results around 830-840). The AI Council clarified that MAE's magnitude depends on the target value's scale.
  * **R2 Score Interpretation:** The R2 score was introduced as a crucial metric for evaluating regression models due to MAE's lack of a universal threshold. A negative R2 score indicates a poor model, while a positive score, especially closer to one, signifies a good model. A log transformation of sales data was shown to improve the R2 score from 0.56 to 0.7.
  * **Hypothesis Testing vs. Model Prediction:** Shravan Kumar's question about using hypothesis testing for model prediction was addressed, with the AI Council clarifying that it is for statistical analysis and interpreting results, not for prediction. They committed to covering hypothesis testing later.
  * **Coefficient Analysis and Scaling:** The importance of scaling features before training a linear regression model was explained. While Item MRP had high correlation with sales, its coefficient was misleadingly low without scaling. Applying `MinMaxScaler` made coefficients accurately reflect feature importance, enhancing model interpretation.
  * **Multicollinearity and Future Topics:** The concept of multicollinearity was introduced, where highly correlated features can complicate individual effect determination. Future sessions will cover adjusted R², Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), and Flask API for model deployment.

The suggested next steps include exploring more feature engineering (multicollinearity, adjusted R-squared, VIF), covering Flask API for model deployment, and addressing hypothesis testing.
