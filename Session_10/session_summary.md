The meeting on July 26, 2025, started with AI Council sharing a new Google Meet link and reviewing the previous nine sessions, including an introduction to machine learning and classification. Kartik Sharma reported completing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) assignment.

AI Council emphasized the importance of hands-on practice, data preparation, feature scaling, and understanding feature magnitude and random state for KNN model training and evaluation. They noted that scaling improved accuracy from 77% to 96%.

The discussion then transitioned to regression problems, introducing linear regression, error optimization with Gradient Descent, and the role of learning rate. AI Council demonstrated the ease of use of `scikit-learn` for linear regression and assigned a task to build a multiple linear regression model for sales prediction.

Key takeaways:

  * **Meeting Logistics & Review:** AI Council changed to Google Meet due to previous glitches and reviewed prior sessions on machine learning and classification.
  * **KNN Assignment & Practice:** Kartik Sharma completed the KNN assignment on the wine quality dataset, and AI Council stressed the importance of hands-on practice for identifying real-world problems.
  * **Data Preparation & Feature Scaling:** The importance of separating features (X) and labels (Y) and data preprocessing was highlighted. Min-Max Scaling was introduced to address differing feature magnitudes in the wine dataset, leading to a significant accuracy improvement from 77% to 96%.
  * **Random State & Cross-Validation:** AI Council explained that `random_state` controls data splitting for consistent results and introduced k-fold cross-validation for a more robust model evaluation.
  * **Introduction to Regression:** The concept of regression was introduced using a sales prediction dataset, distinguishing it from classification by its continuous target variable.
  * **Linear Regression & Gradient Descent:** AI Council explained linear regression's goal of finding a "best fit line" (Y = MX + C) to minimize prediction error. Gradient Descent was detailed as an algorithm to optimize weights (M and C) by iteratively adjusting them based on the error's gradient.
  * **Learning Rate:** The "learning rate" was introduced as a crucial parameter to control the step size in Gradient Descent, preventing overshooting the minimum error.
  * **Scikit-learn vs. Manual Implementation:** AI Council demonstrated that `scikit-learn` simplifies linear regression implementation while yielding similar results to manual Gradient Descent, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying mathematical concepts.
  * **Assignment:** Participants were assigned to build a multiple linear regression model for sales prediction using both TV and radio expenses as features.

**Next Steps:**

  * AI Council will further explain feature interaction and nonlinearity.
  * AI Council will review the assignment.
  * Kartik Sharma will attempt the assignment.
