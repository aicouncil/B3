# Detailed Explanation of Everything in "G3_d6_pandas.ipynb"

This notebook introduces and demonstrates the essential features of the Pandas library in Python, focusing on its two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame. The explanations below are chunked by topic and include all code, outputs, and contextual details present in the notebook. Every topic, example, and code snippet is accounted for and explained in depth.

---

## 1. **Introduction to Pandas**

**What is Pandas?**

- **Pandas** is a Python library designed for data analysis and manipulation.
- It provides **fast, flexible, and expressive data structures** for working with structured (table-like) data.
- With Pandas, you can easily **load, clean, filter, analyze, and visualize** data.
- It works seamlessly with data from various sources like **Excel, CSV, SQL databases, JSON**, and more.
- **Pandas is built on top of NumPy** and leverages its computational power.

**Key Points:**
- Designed for data analysis tasks.
- Makes handling tabular data easy and efficient.
- Integrates well with other data formats and Python libraries.

## 2. **Pandas Series**

### **What is a Series?**

- A **Series** is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integers, strings, floats, etc.).
- Think of it as a single column of data.

### **Example: Creating a Series**

```python
import pandas as pd

weights = [54, 55, 59, 65, 63, 67]
d1 = pd.Series(weights)
d1
```

**Output:**
```
0    54
1    55
2    59
3    65
4    63
5    67
dtype: int64
```
- The left column (0, 1, 2, ...) is the index, automatically assigned.
- The right column is the data (weights).
- `dtype: int64` describes the data type.

---

## 3. **Series Type and Operations**

### **Checking the Type**

```python
print(type(d1))
```
**Output:**
```
<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
```
- Confirms that `d1` is a Pandas Series object.

### **Basic Series Operations**

You can perform operations like mean, max, and sum directly on a Series.

```python
print(d1.mean())
print(d1.max())
print(d1.sum())
```
**Output:**
```
60.5
67
363
```
- `d1.mean()` returns the average value of the weights.
- `d1.max()` returns the maximum value.
- `d1.sum()` returns the total sum of the Series values.

## 4. **DataFrame Introduction**

### **What is a DataFrame?**

- A **DataFrame** is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
- Think of it as a table (like a spreadsheet or SQL table) in Python.
- **DataFrames are heterogeneous**, meaning each column can hold a different data type (int, string, float, etc.).

---

## 5. **Creating DataFrames**

### **Step 1: Creating a Dictionary**

```python
user_data = {
    "name": ["Ravi", "Sanjay", "Ajay", "Sameer", "Pavan"],
    "weights": [56, 54, 57, 49, 59],
    "city": ["Delhi", "Jaipur", "Indore", "Mysore", "Vizag"]
}
print(user_data)
```
**Output:**
```
{'name': ['Ravi', 'Sanjay', 'Ajay', 'Sameer', 'Pavan'], 'weights': [56, 54, 57, 49, 59], 'city': ['Delhi', 'Jaipur', 'Indore', 'Mysore', 'Vizag']}
```
- The data is organized in a Python dictionary, where each key represents a column and its value is a list of column entries.

---

## 6. **Creating and Displaying a DataFrame**

### **Step 2: Creating the DataFrame**

```python
d2 = pd.DataFrame(user_data)
d2
```

**Output:**
```
     name  weights    city
0    Ravi       56   Delhi
1  Sanjay       54  Jaipur
2    Ajay       57  Indore
3  Sameer       49  Mysore
4   Pavan       59   Vizag
```

- The DataFrame `d2` displays data in a tabular format with automatically assigned row indices (0 to 4).
- Each column derives from the dictionary keys.

---

## 7. **Checking DataFrame Type**

```python
print(type(d2))
```
**Output:**
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
```
- Verifies that `d2` is a DataFrame object.

---

## 8. **Checking Data Types of DataFrame Columns**

```python
d2.dtypes
```
**Output:**
```
name       object
weights     int64
city       object
dtype: object
```
- `name` and `city` columns are of type `object` (typically used for strings).
- `weights` is of type `int64` (integers).

---

## 9. **Displaying the DataFrame Again**

```python
d2
```
**Output:**
```
     name  weights    city
0    Ravi       56   Delhi
1  Sanjay       54  Jaipur
2    Ajay       57  Indore
3  Sameer       49  Mysore
4   Pavan       59   Vizag
```
- Re-displaying the DataFrame reinforces understanding of its structure.
